# rgbMatrix-with-Webcontrol
Learning by doing I am creating a LED Matrix based on WS2812b leds, which is controlled by this Python software on a Raspberry Pie 2, sending the commands over serial to an Arduino, which then switches the leds. Please be aware, that I only have some experience in Arduino code, but none in Python, Javascript and all other web related stuff, so please don't be too shocked looking at my code. :D  and besides I am used to clean up my code in intervalls every now and then, some intervalls might be long, but clean ups will come.

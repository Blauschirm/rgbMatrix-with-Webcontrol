Learning while building, I am creating a LED Matrix based on WS2812b leds, which is controlled by this Python software on a Raspberry Pi 2, sending the commands over serial communication to an Arduino, which then switches the leds. Please be aware that I only have some experience in Arduino code, but none in Python, Javascript and all other web related stuff, so please don't be too shocked looking at my code :D  and besides: I am used to clean up my code in intervalls every now and then, some intervalls might be long, but clean ups will come.

Used non standard libraries:
  -PySerial [pip]
  -Pillow   [pip]   [https://python-pillow.github.io/]
  -Tornado  [pip]   [http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/]
  -Graphics         [http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py]
